# webScripts

This a collection of my personal webScripts using a web browser extension called ViolentMonkey similar to TamperMonkey or FireMonkey.
Feel free to adjust my scripts to your liking.

## Explanation

- 4chan-settings.js
  - Personally I run Librewolf with cookieAutoDelete, containers, along with clearing the history, cookies and site settings once the session is closed. I personally think that this is essential for privacy and security. However this also has a few downsides, with the one being that it automatically clear your settings each time. This extension automatically inserts my settings for 4chan without having to manually apply them myself.
- enable-vueDevTools.js
  - I think that analyzing how a website works with Vue is paramount to learning more about a website and the technology, this is useful for many reasons and should be the default for the Vue extension. Especially when you want to view and analyze your website in production builds as the viewers are seeing it analyzing is essential to spot any bugs or security/privacy exploits.
